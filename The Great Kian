/*The great Kian is looking for a smart prime minister. He's looking for a guy who can solve the OLP (Old Legendary Problem). OLP is an old problem (obviously) that no one was able to solve it yet (like P=NP).

But still, you want to be the prime minister really bad. So here's the problem:

Given the sequence a1, a2, ..., an find the three values a1 + a4 + a7 + ..., a2 + a5 + a8 + ... and a3 + a6 + a9 + ... (these summations go on while the indexes are valid).

Input
The first line of input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 105).

The second line contains n integers a1, a2, ..., an separated by space (1 ≤ ai ≤ 109).

Output
Print three values in one line (the answers).

SAMPLE INPUT 
5
1 2 3 4 5

SAMPLE OUTPUT 
5 7 3
