We define the distance between two array values as the number of indices between the two values. Given , find the minimum distance between any pair of equal elements in the array. If no such value exists, print .

For example, if , there are two matching pairs of values: . The indices of the 's are  and , so their distance is . The indices of the 's are  and , so their distance is .

Function Description

Complete the minimumDistances function in the editor below. It should return the minimum distance between any two matching elements.

minimumDistances has the following parameter(s):

a: an array of integers
Input Format

The first line contains an integer , the size of array . 
The second line contains  space-separated integers .

Constraints

Output Format

Print a single integer denoting the minimum  in . If no such value exists, print .

Sample Input
